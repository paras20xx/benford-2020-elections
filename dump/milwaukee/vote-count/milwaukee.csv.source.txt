// Note: dump/milwaukee/vote-count/milwaukee.csv was generated directly from the official
// site (https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/County-Clerk/Off-Nav/Election-Results/Election-Results-Fall-2020)
// and that is used for final calculations.

// Note that some of the data on the site has minor mismatches related to totals (eg: Ballots Cast), but that
// shouldn't impact the analysis as such.
